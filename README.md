# Binary Conversion Assessment Tool

### Project Overview
This project is an interactive educational tool developed for the course **"Historical Development of Mathematical Concepts and Ideas"** at the University of Delaware. It was designed to transition from traditional passive lecturing to an active learning environment by providing a real-time assessment platform for binary and decimal number systems.

### Educational Impact
The primary objective was to ensure that students could fluently master the conversion between binary and decimal values. By integrating this tool into my academic presentation, I was able to verify student understanding instantly. 

Upon seeing the effectiveness of this tool and my delivery, the professor commended my ability to simplify complex concepts and noted that I possess a natural talent for professional teaching and clear communication.

### Key Features
* **Dual Conversion Practice:** Supports challenges for both Binary-to-Decimal and Decimal-to-Binary conversions.
* **Instant Feedback:** Provides real-time validation of user input to reinforce correct mathematical logic.
* **Pedagogical Design:** Focused on maximizing learner engagement and reducing the barrier to entry for abstract concepts.
* **Assessment Driven:** Functions as a practical evaluation tool to measure learning outcomes during or after a lesson.
